    Data source
    -----------
    Reads from the **actor_collaborations** precomputed table, which is built

        • "cast"        — Wikidata-sourced links (Sprints 1-5, 13 original actors)

    at query time keeps response latency sub-millisecond regardless of dataset size.

    The table stores both directions (A→B and B→A).  The WHERE clause
    ``actor1_id < actor2_id`` selects only one canonical direction per pair,
    eliminating duplicates without a DISTINCT pass.

    Build a mixed list of 8 dynamic cinema insight objects for the homepage.

    1. Collaboration insights — actor pairs with the most shared films,
       sourced from the precomputed actor_collaborations table.  The
       ``actor1_id < actor2_id`` guard picks one canonical direction per pair.

    2. Director partnership insights — actor + director duos with the highest
       co-film counts, computed from actor_movies ⋈ movies.

    3. Supporting actor insights — the most prolific supporting performers,
       computed from actor_movies rows where role_type = 'supporting'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    industry : Optional industry filter (e.g. "telugu", "tamil").  Pass None
               or "all" for the cross-industry global view.  Matching is
               case-insensitive against the actors.industry column.
               When a specific industry is selected the director HAVING
               threshold is relaxed from 4 → 2 to ensure results even for
               smaller industries (e.g. Kannada).

    Interleaving strategy
    ---------------------
    Zip the three lists together (collab, director, supporting, collab, …)

    Return directors ranked by number of films in the database.

    Data source
    -----------
    Reads from the legacy ``movies.director`` TEXT column — the denormalized
    field that is always populated.  The normalised ``movie_directors`` join
    table is more correct but only covers a subset of movies; this query uses
    the legacy column for maximum coverage.

    Filtering
    ---------
    industry : optional case-insensitive match against ``movies.industry``.
               Pass None / "all" / "explore" for the cross-industry view.

    Deduplication
    -------------
    Only directors with ≥ 2 films are included — eliminates one-off credits
    that pollute the leaderboard with unique names.

    Returns
    -------
    List of Row objects with fields: name (str), film_count (int),
    industries (str — comma-separated, e.g. "Telugu, Tamil").
