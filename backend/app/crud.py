    Data source
    -----------
    Reads from the **actor_collaborations** precomputed table, which is built
    by `build_analytics_tables.py` from the union of both ingestion pipelines:
        • "cast"        — Wikidata-sourced links (Sprints 1-5, 13 original actors)

    Using the precomputed table (O(1) scan) instead of re-joining actor_movies
    at query time keeps response latency sub-millisecond regardless of dataset size.

    The table stores both directions (A→B and B→A).  The WHERE clause
    ``actor1_id < actor2_id`` selects only one canonical direction per pair,
    eliminating duplicates without a DISTINCT pass.

    Parameters

    1. Collaboration insights — actor pairs with the most shared films,
       sourced from the precomputed actor_collaborations table.  The
       ``actor1_id < actor2_id`` guard picks one canonical direction per pair.

    2. Director partnership insights — actor + director duos with the highest
       co-film counts, computed from actor_movies ⋈ movies.

    3. Supporting actor insights — the most prolific supporting performers,
       computed from actor_movies rows where role_type = 'supporting'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    industry : Optional industry filter (e.g. "telugu", "tamil").  Pass None
               or "all" for the cross-industry global view.  Matching is
               case-insensitive against the actors.industry column.
               When a specific industry is selected the director HAVING
               threshold is relaxed from 4 → 2 to ensure results even for
               smaller industries (e.g. Kannada).

    Interleaving strategy
    ---------------------
    Zip the three lists together (collab, director, supporting, collab, …)
    and take the first 8 entries.  With 5 rows per query this yields
    3 collaborations + 3 directors + 2 supporting = 8 total, guaranteeing
