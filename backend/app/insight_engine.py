insight_engine.py — WOW Insight Engine for South Cinema Analytics

Generates surprising, story-driven insights for the homepage.
Each pattern returns a list of candidates; the engine scores and
selects the best 3–4 diverse insights for display.

Fail-safe: a broken pattern is silently skipped so one bad query
never crashes the homepage.

v2 additions (backward-compatible):
  • In-memory TTL cache (10 min) — no DB hit on every request
  • Weighted log-based scoring — balances large numbers vs rare patterns
  • confidence field (0–1) — simple score normalisation
  • Logging — candidates generated, scores, final selection

v3 additions (backward-compatible):
  • Thread-safe cache — Lock protects reads/writes; compute runs outside lock
  • Smoother confidence curve — score / 100 instead of score / 50
  • title field — replaces headline for consistent API contract
  • category field — "collaboration" | "network" | "career" | "industry"

v4 additions:
  • collab_shock — requires BOTH actors to be primary (filters obscure pairs)
  • career_peak  — value is now win_films (int), not a year-range string;
                   unit = "films in 5 years"; year range kept in subtext only
  • director_loyalty — director name added to actors[] so card renders as duo;
                       unit = "films together" (consistent with collab_shock)
  • hidden_dominance — minimum raised from 20 → 100 films (filters obscure actors)
  • _score()    — four components: magnitude, type weight, primary bonus, clarity
  • _pick_diverse() — one insight per category max; min score floor; hard cap of 4

v5 additions:
  • _enrich_with_fame() — single bulk SQL stamps film_count + costar_count onto
                          every candidate after collection (no per-insight queries)
  • _fame_score()       — tiered points for film_count / costar_count / is_primary
  • _relatability_score() — rewards integer values and clear count-based units
  • _wow_score()        — tiered magnitude bonuses + pattern-specific surprises
  • _hard_filter()      — removes insights below per-type value floors and
                          collab_shock pairs where either actor has < 50 films
  • _score()            — now composes the three sub-scores + a type base weight
  • _MIN_SCORE raised to 55 — ensures only high-fame or high-wow cards survive

v6 additions (extend & refine only — no existing logic removed):
  • _fame_score()       — recognition boost: +10 if is_primary AND film_count >= 150
                          (globally recognisable tier); fame cap raised 40 → 50
  • _wow_score()        — shock override: +15 for value >= 500, +10 for value >= 400
                          (stacked on top of existing magnitude tiers); cap raised 30 → 50
  • _duo_wow_boost()    — new helper: +10 for collab_shock where both actors score
                          is_primary=True AND film_count >= 150
  • _headline_readiness() — new helper: -8 penalty when value/unit combo won't render
                            cleanly as a large-number card
  • _score()            — adds duo_wow and headline to composite; breakdown updated
  • _hard_filter()      — Rule 6: non-hidden_dominance types require at least one
                          primary actor; hidden_dominance now requires film_count >= 200
  • _pick_diverse()     — 3-pass algorithm: (1) one-per-category, (2) fallback fill
                          if score > 75, (3) supporting cap (max 1 hidden_dominance)
