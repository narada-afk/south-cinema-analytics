"""
insight_engine.py — WOW Insight Engine for South Cinema Analytics

Generates surprising, story-driven insights for the homepage.
Each pattern returns a single insight dict (or None if the condition
is not met by the current dataset).

The engine collects all candidates, scores them by impact, and
returns the top 3 diverse insights — at most 1 per type.

Fail-safe: a broken pattern is silently skipped so one bad query
never crashes the homepage.

v2 additions (backward-compatible):
  • In-memory TTL cache (10 min) — no DB hit on every request
  • Weighted log-based scoring — balances large numbers vs rare patterns
  • confidence field (0–1) — simple score normalisation
  • Logging — candidates generated, scores, final selection

v3 additions (backward-compatible):
  • Thread-safe cache — Lock protects reads/writes; compute runs outside lock
  • Smoother confidence curve — score / 100 instead of score / 50
  • title field — replaces headline for consistent API contract
  • category field — "collaboration" | "network" | "career" | "industry"
